# Sepolia Uniswap Router 🔄🌐

## Motivation

This repository aims to provide the Uniswap Router contract deployment on Sepolia, a decentralized blockchain platform. The motivation behind creating this repository is to address the absence of the Uniswap Router ABI (Application Binary Interface) in the Sepolia ecosystem. By deploying the Uniswap Router contract on Sepolia, developers and users can interact with Uniswap's decentralized exchange functionality on the Sepolia network.

## Features

- Deploy the Uniswap Router contract on the Sepolia blockchain.
- Enable seamless interaction with Uniswap's decentralized exchange on Sepolia.
- Support for routing trades and liquidity provision on Sepolia using Uniswap-compatible tools and applications.

## Prerequisites

To deploy the Uniswap Router contract on Sepolia, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A Sepolia developer account 🧑‍💻
- Access to the Sepolia blockchain network 🔒
- Solidity development environment (e.g., Solidity compiler, Truffle, or Hardhat) 🛠️

## Deployment

To deploy the Sepolia Uniswap Router contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/hakizimana-fred/sepolia-uniswap-router` 📥
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sepolia-uniswap-router` 📂
3. Update the contract code or configuration if necessary. 🔄
4. Compile the contract code using your preferred Solidity development environment. ⚙️
5. Deploy the contract on the Sepolia blockchain network. 🚀
6. Verify the contract deployment and obtain the contract address. ✅
7. Integrate the Uniswap Router contract address into your Sepolia-based applications or tools. 🔄🌐
